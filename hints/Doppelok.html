    <div class="answer">
        Well, let start with the main idea of this mission. You need to walk through the given string, take each word and reverse it.
         For example, you can use "for" loop or list comprehensions (which be more shortly and elegant solution).

    <div class="question">
        How to use a "for" loop?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Let me show you how the "for" loop works. For example, we have the string "honey" and we really want it
         go through the "for" loop and try to output each letter. So the code will look like this:
        <pre class="brush: python">
for i in "honey":  # This is the beginning of a "for" loop, where the "i"
            # is the variable to which each letter is assigned one step at a time
    print(i)  # Here we will output the variable "Ñ–",
>> h  # We will get this in the first step
>> o  # We will get this in the second step
>> n  # We will get this in the third step and so on until the end of the string
>> e
>> y
        </pre>
        As you can see, there is nothing complicated here.

    <div class="question">
Wow, good! Now please explain to me what is a list comprehensions?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        List comprehensions is easy! A list comprehensions returns a list. With list comprehensions
          we can write the "for" loop expression in one line! For example, let's make it so that all elements in the line "honey"
          became double. Here is the code:
        <pre class="brush: python">
a = "honey"
[i*2 for i in a]  # Here we take each letter and double it by multiplying by 2
>> ['hh', 'oo', 'nn', 'ee', 'yy']  # As you can see, it received a list in response
# but all letters became double
        </pre>
        Don't worry, if you still need to get a string, use the string method <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=str">"''.join()"</a>.
        <pre class="brush: python">
a = 'honey'
b = [i*2 for i in a]
>> ['hh', 'oo', 'nn', 'ee', 'yy']
''.join(b)  # In parentheses, we pass the object that we want to "fold" back into a string
>> 'hhoonneeyy'
' '.join(b)  # And if we put a space in '', then all letters will be combined into a string
            # through spaces. Read in detail at the link above.
>> 'hh oo nn ee yy'
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        How to break words into letters is clear to me. But how do I break a sentence into words?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        For such a case, use the method <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=str%20split">"str.split()"</a>.
         This will help you split the given string into a list of words:
        <pre class="brush: python">
d = "Bear loves honey"
c = d.split()
# >> ['Bear', 'loves', 'honey']  # But as you can see, the spaces have disappeared
c = d.split(' ')  # We pass a space in the argument
>> ['Bear', 'loves', ' ', 'honey']  # Everything is in place
            # For a detailed explanation, read the link above.
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        So, how do I reverse the word?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        For example, you have a word "honey", and you need to reverse it. Of course, you can use instruction <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/functions.html?highlight=reversed#reversed">"reversed"</a>.
         But here is more short and simple expression:
        <pre class="brush: python">
a = "honey"
a[::-1]  #>> 'yenoh'
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        Okay, I have all elements to finish this mission... But I'm missing something...
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Your final code will look something like this. Here we will also need the method <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=str%20split"> ".append()"</a>.
        <pre class="brush: python">
def backward_string_by_word(text: str) -> str:
    new_text = text.split(' ')  # Divide into a list
    result = []
    for i in new_text:
        result .append(i[::-1])  # Turn it over and add it to the list
    return ' '.join(result)  # Combine into a line
        </pre>
        But this code can be written in a handy list generator. Look:
        <pre class="brush: python">
def backward_string_by_word(text: str) -> str:
    return ' '.join([x[::-1] for x in text.split(' ')])
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>
