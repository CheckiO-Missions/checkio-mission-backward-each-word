            Well, let start with the main idea of this mission. You need to walk through the given string, take each word and reverse it. For example, you can use <b class="code">for</b> loop or list comprehensions (which be more shortly and elegant solution).

    <div class="question">
        <p>
            How to use a <b class="code">for</b> loop?
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            Let me show you how the <b class="code">for</b> loop works. For example, we have the string <b class="code">"honey"</b> and we really want it go through the <b class="code">for</b> loop and try to output each letter. So the code will look like this:
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
# This is the beginning of a "for" loop, where the "i"
# is the variable to which each letter is assigned one step at a time           
for i in "honey":  
    # Here we will output the variable "Ñ–"        
    print(i)  
        </pre>
        <div class="output">
            <p>Output:</p>
            <pre>
h
o
n
e
y</pre>
        </div>
        <p>
            As you can see, there is nothing complicated here. We will get <b class="code">"h"</b> in the first step, <b class="code">"o"</b> at the second, <b class="code">"n"</b> at the third and so on until the end of the string.

    <div class="question">
        <p>
            Wow, good! Now please explain to me what is a list comprehensions?
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            List comprehension is easy! A list comprehension returns a list. With list comprehensions we can write the <b class="code">for</b> loop expression in one line! For example, let's make it so that all elements in the line <b class="code">"honey"</b> became double. Here is the code:
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
a = "honey"
# Here we take each letter and double it by multiplying by 2
b = [i*2 for i in a]
print(b)
        </pre>
        <div class="output">
            <p>Output:</p>
            <pre>
['hh', 'oo', 'nn', 'ee', 'yy']</pre>
        </div>
        <p>
            As you can see, it received a list in response, but all letters became double. Don't worry, if you still need to get a string, use the string method <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=str">"''.join()"</a>.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
# In parentheses, we pass the object that we want to "fold"
# back into a string            
print(''.join(b))
        </pre>
        <div class="output">
            <p>Output:</p>
            <pre>
'hhoonneeyy'</pre>
        </div>     
        <p>
            Or
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
# And if we put a space in '', then all letters will be combined into
# a string through spaces. Read in detail at the link above.
print(' '.join(b))        
        </pre>
        <div class="output">
            <p>Output:</p>
            <pre>
'hh oo nn ee yy'

    <div class="question">
        <p>
            How to break words into letters is clear to me. But how do I break a sentence into words?

    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            For such a case, use a method <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=str%20split">str.split()</a>. This will help you to split the given string into a list of words:
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
# Two spaces after the word loves            
d = "Bear loves  honey"
c = d.split()
# But as you can see, the spaces have disappeared
print(c)
        </pre>
        <div class="output">
            <p>Output:</p>
            <pre>
['Bear', 'loves', 'honey']</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Or</p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
# We pass a space in the argument. Everything is in place.
c = d.split(' ')
print(c)     
        </pre>
        <div class="output">
            <p>Output:</p>
            <pre>
['Bear', 'loves', ' ', 'honey']</pre>

<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">

            So, how do I reverse the word?

    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            For example, you have a word <b class="code">"honey"</b>, and you need to reverse it. Of course, you can use <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/functions.html?highlight=reversed#reversed">reversed</a> method. But here is more short and simple expression:
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
a = "honey"
print(a[::-1])
        </pre>
        <div class="output">
            <p>Output:</p>
            <pre>
'yenoh'</pre>

            Your final code will look something like this. Here we will also need the method <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=str%20split">.append()</a>.
        </p>
        <div class="spoiler">
        <pre class="brush: python">
def backward_string_by_word(text: str) -> str:
    # Divide into a list
    new_text = text.split(' ')  
    result = []
    for i in new_text:
        # Turn it over and add it to the list
        result .append(i[::-1])
    # Combine into a line     
    return ' '.join(result)  
        </pre>
        </div>
        <p>
            But this code can be written in a handy list generator. Look:
        </p>
        <div class="spoiler">
        <pre class="brush: python">
def backward_string_by_word(text: str) -> str:

    return ' '.join(x[::-1] for x in text.split(' '))
        </pre>
